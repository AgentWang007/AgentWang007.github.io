  <h1>Value Talk</h1>
  <h2>Not related to the Adams Family film</h2>
  <h4>08/21/2015</h4>
    <h4> Intro </h4>
    <p>
      Values are nice. I started looking at a list of values that I associate with happiness, proudest, or most satisfying. It's absolutely daunting. Technically, I should be feeling all of these values, right? For those who don't have the list, DBC has a table that feels astronomically large. Therefore, I'm going to try my best to narrow down a few values I feel is relevant to my best moments.
    </p>
    <h4> The Values </h4>
    <p>
      Accomplishment is value that I have associated with happier moments. This is not related to winning an award or getting into a program. Instead, I think of accomplishment as something I did that sort of makes the day worthwhile. For instance, if I happen to see my nephew and I spent a wonderful day with him, I consider that an accomplishment. I made him feel happy and contributed to his development which makes me feel I made the most of my time. Another example of feeling accomplished is if I made somebody's life easier or helped them out with a task. I definitely get a nice kick out of it so you could call it altruism as well. In general, out of a scale of 1-5, I would put down a 4 in terms of how I live by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I speak of accomplishment in the same way as another value known as "helping others." I like helping others and it is almost an important part of my happiness at times. I suppose as a side effect of this, I tend to not like other people helping me (which has its own detrimental effects). In general, out of a scale of 1-5, I would put down a 5 in terms of how I live by this. Helping others allow me to sort of increase a level of accomplishment which could lead to recognition (another value!).
    </p>

    <p>
      Frankly, I don't go searching for recognition. However, I cannot admit that I do like positive recognition when it does apply. All human beings do like positive recognition unless it rings with a false motive. For instance, in the peer reviews for DBC, I find people stating "I loved working with you" before trashing them completely. As a result, we have become a society that relies on false praise/recognition. However, when real recognition does roll around, it is a genuinely great feeling.In general, out of a scale of 1-5, I would put down a 3 in terms of how I live by this.
        </p>
<h4> Advice Column </h4>
  <p>
      Actually, I give advice on a daily basis. I tend to surround myself with social drama which may inevitably involve me. As a result of these circumstances, I tend to spend time texting or gchatting with family and friends about a social issue in their lives. Recently, my friend was complaining about her life and how she was afraid of doing the thing that she loves. In these type of situations, I tend to just express my thoughts about what the situation looks like from MY PERSPECTIVE without trying to force someone to think like me. Advice can be tricky because you don't want somebody to take advice because YOU THINK IT IS RIGHT. Instead, they should come to an understanding of how they feel about the situation and go forth with an answer they are satisfied. Does it always work out that way? Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's human to either rely on somebody else to tell you what to do. it's also human to just ignore the advice and stick to your guns as well. Regarding my friend, she felt like she just needed to voice her own concerns to somebody besides her loved ones. Even if she has heard the same advice over and over again, she finds value in hearing advice from different people especially if there is some overlap.
  </p>

  <p>
    So knowing all this about my own value system, how does it help me? I'm not too sure. I think it is important to overcome your own self doubts and just remember the core values. I think setting realistic accomplishments at DBC may help with defining my progress as well. There will be others that will move faster and know more than me at the program. However, if I can make my own tentpoles for satisfaction, I think I won't feel as left behind. Also, I think engaging in teaching sessions (as a student then hopefully a teacher) will make me feel like I'm helping others. I'm sure if I do make real progress, then somebody will offer true recognition for the hard work I put in. I think this is how I will survive. I could be wrong though. Let's find out :-D.
