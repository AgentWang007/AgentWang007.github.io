  <h1>The Stereotype</h1>
  <h2>Dealing with it?</h2>
  <h4>08/16/2015</h4>
    <h4>Positive or Negative?</h4>
    <p>
  All my life, I grew up with the weird assumption that Asians are better than everybody else. Amongst my family, we are expected to outperform other races because we "work harder" and work ethics are "better." Certainly, when I was growing up, my own parents would tell me that others races were problematic in very non-PC ways. I won't go into details on this blog, but I am willing to admit that I grew up in an environment that was passively "racist." </p>

  <p> As a result of my own life path though, I really don't have this perception affecting me or even worry about how others view me. In my own way, I grew up believing that I was "Jason" and not "Chinese Jason." I attribute this to the many people I have met through my life. Regardless of whoever I met, I usually only viewed them on those particular encounters. Let me go into this further. </p>

    </p>
    <h4> Peer Pairings Reflect This! </h4>
    <p>
    One great thing about peer pairing is that I get to work with a variety of different people. I've work with asian, hispanic, italian, and caucasian indviduals thus far and I suspect that the diversity will only continue. When I start these encounters, I don't think of racial stereotypes. Instead, I think about whether the partner's attitude and approachability first. For me, the work becomes the foremost important factor regardless of any stereotypes associated. I don't look at my "white partners" and think they just got back from the beach!

    </p>

    <h4> What about employers? </h4>
    <p>
      To be clear, I'm not pretending racism or stereotyping doesn't exist. In fact, the act of ignoring it is almost as bad as being racist because it is another type of ignorance. I may feel comfortable with how I view my own identity and how I view others, but the rest of the world doesn't work like that. Other employers will look at someone like me and most likely will assume a particular work ethic. In fact, I'm assuming that a prospective employer will make a "You look like Gangam Style from that youtube video!" at my expense. </p>

      <p>
        I wouldn't know how to combat this except to smile and say that I "get that a lot." All I feel like I can control is how I feel about the situation and not somebody else's feelings. I suspect I will not let it bother me. In some ways, I may be lucky because most Asian stereotypes are positive. For others who are less fortunate, I will just hope they can be happy in being assured of their own identity and to keep that in mind when interacting with others. Ultimately, it's your productivity that should define you, not your ethnicity.
