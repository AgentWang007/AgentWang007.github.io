  <h1>Memories</h1>
  <h2>The Computer Related Ones</h2>

    <h4> Intro </h4>
    <p>
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve happen to run into people who buy RAM or a new HD (hard drive, not high definition!) when a computer starts running “slow”. Generally, like most people, we want our products to just “work” and just want to buy an add-on that should automatically fix the problem. I actually don’t have a problem with this approach because they are fixing their problem. However, they also have no idea what RAM or Hard Drives actually do. Honestly, I didn’t really understand it either. I always thought of RAM in a very loose way. For example, if the CPU is the strong beating heat and the HD was a closet, RAM was the brain that manages all the applications while they run. Well, I was wrong. I mean I’m sort of right, but I’m also wrong. After some research, I came across some interesting things.
    </p>
    <h4> RAM means what? </h4>
    <p>
RAM actually stands for something. Random access memory means that any part of memory can be read from or written to directly. This sounds like mumbo jumbo, but it basically means that it doesn’t matter WHERE you are in the memory. If you think of the structure physically, it wouldn’t matter if you were left, right, up, or down. Memory can still do its job. This can be applied to HDs as well actually. It also turns out there are two types of memory too. One big confusion that occurs is in regard to “flash memory  storage” which is what you buy for cameras, smartphones, and most devices nowadays. Why is this memory different from the RAM? It basically comes down to volatile versus non-volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
When the CPU is running applications such as the word processor, it needs RAM to store information in a short-term manner. Volatile memory is basically memory that needs electricity to power it to retain information. This can be memory that is always electrically charged or only needs an occasional surge to function properly. For the short term/active projects, this is a very useful task. If you imagine it  as a human brain, we work best when working in the short term  and it takes time to achieve real long-term memory. Of course, it is “volatile” due to this power requirement to retain memory. Your memory sticks don’t require power to retain memory. Now, you have probably heard of VRAM (virtual) and this refers to the hard drive. The hard drive can also store information including actively running programs. However, RAM itself is designed to be better at it and is much faster at managing them. VRAM is certainly used when you are taxing the current RAM, but it doesn’t replace the need for something that works with active processes.
