<h1>The Art of a Good Question</h1>
  <h2>Riddle Me This</h2>
  <h4>09/04/2015</h4>
    <h4>How has it been with asking questions?</h4>
    <p>
      I think it is natural to ask a question that is a naturally terrible question. On a daily basis, we tend to just ask things off the top of our heads to ourselves and others. Naturally, we expect everyone to be privy to all your thoughts and therefore the proper context surrounding the question. Family, friends, and significant others can usually guess what we are asking without needing additional information. However, the reality is that to most people, we tend to ask questions that are poorly delivered. The problem is not with the question itself though. In fact, I think it comes down to presentation and context.
    </p>
    <h4> The Presentation </h4>
    <p>
       On Google+, I noticed a few people asking questions about coding which is natural. There isn't anything wrong with asking a question about coding especially since we are mostly all new to the process. However, I noticed the difference between a good presentation and a bad presentation. Let's start off with a bad presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When people ask a bad question, the content is sound. They are usually having a problem with the code. They usually ask if anybody is having a problem with the challenge or just throwing the error message into the window. However, there are few problems with doing something like that. First off, it is much easier to determine what the error message means if you actually see the code in front of you. Second, when you ask vaguely about a problem with a challenge, you have to provide much greater detail. Especially with coding, there are multiple problems that can arise just due to simple syntax errors from the user. So, what is a good question presentation? It is preferable to give the code block. Depending on what you are running, this can look like a huge mess of code. However, with the error messages, it instantly becomes a little easier to figure out the reason behind the failures. In addition, someone can comment on whether or not your approach is faulty to begin with. Therefore, if you can at least present the code block, you are improving the presentation of the question.
    </p>
    <h4> The Context </h4>

    <p>
      Earlier, I mentioned that someone can look at your code block and help you refactor. Heck, they can even change your entire approach. This is a big thing. However, when you are presenting your code to somebody that is not aware of the challenge or mission, you must provide proper context. In other words, you have to state your intent. For example, I found good questions to include a variaton on the "user story" or "pseudocode." "User story" on sites such as StackOverflow tend to lead to multiple responses. When you provide a mission for your question, it leads to programmers attempting to solve the challenge via their own approach. If you offer some pseudocode, people online may look at your pseudocode and comment on it. They can call it trash or help you along with your code. Therefore, I think it is important to provide a good context for your problem too. Not only will you get better responses, but I think the learning process is better as well. It becomes more collaborative!
