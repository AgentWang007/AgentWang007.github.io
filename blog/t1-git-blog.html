  <h1>GIT</h1>
  <h2>A System For the Anal Compulsive Programer</h2>
  <h4>07/10/2015</h4>
    <h4>Why Version Control?</h4>
    <p>
      Have you ever used a Word Document? Used a spreadsheet? Made a powerpoint? Well, I want to inform you that you are using a type of version control. It means that there is a system in place that keeps track of changes you are making to an ongoing work/project. It isn't quite the version control that GIT is, but it is a similar concept. Some people like to make additional documents with basic changes in order to save it for later use or the apocalypse. My own mother is guilty of this during tax season and makes triple copies of excel spreadsheets. However, what happens when you save on that ONE document? You lost the previous changes forever! </p>
    <h4> Get over how GIT is not a backup</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a a great type of version control software that lets you follow changes on a project including the ones that are made by contributers. Imagine being a project leader and having multiple people tinkering with features on a program. Instead of being stuck to waiting for you to offer a complete master, they can basically do their own work until it is ready for merging into the original. GIT is a system that allows you to work this way. What if somebody introduces a change that doesn't agree with the system? Why don't we just undo that last commit/save point so we figure out how to fix the problem? Yup. This is an option and a good one that is used regularly in GIT. However, GIT is not a backup system like Apple Time Machine or Windows Restore. GIT happens to have remote backups as a great feature, but it is primarily designed as a way to track progress and push/merge changes in a smart fashion.
