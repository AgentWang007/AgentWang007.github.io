    <p> Welcome to the first post! I'm doing this for an assignment, but I hope to use this further in my career. Enjoy reading! <p>

    <h5> Describe Version Control </h5>
    <p>
      Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to the system you are operating. This involve changes to a project or even a single file! I guess you could say everybody has used version control at some point in your lifetime. For example, have you ever made a mostly completed rough draft prior to the final product under a different final name? That is an example of a local version control that you applied yourself.

<p>
  When my mother does taxes, she actually renamed and places each copy based upon some criteria. This could be a year or a color. She is so paranoid about losing an original, that the file names all have the word "copy" in it. Nowadays, operating systems like Windows can have restore points or even Apple uses Time Machine to record moments or versions to playback if something go awry. However, we live in a wonderful age of the internet! Places like github offer a remote version control system which means that even if the local fails, the remote can be a backup. Even if something happened remotely, any computer that has copied a clone off of it can just bring it back up. Nice.

  <h5> Explain how git tracks changes </h5>
    <p>
       Git tracks changes very carefully. When you pull up git status, you will see a couple of categories. There are files to be committed, files not committed, and untracked files. Basically, any time you you apply a chang, git status will let you know what has been modified. In order to apply this change further, you have to add an untracked file via a command such as "git add ." Once you add the file, the next step is to decided if the file should be committed. A commit is great because it serves as a save point and it gives you a chance to thoughtfully add changes. Every commit requires a message (hopefully an informative one in present tense) so that you or somebody else can understand what they would gain by applying this particular change to the project.

<h5> Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code </h5>
    <p>
      Github is a great way to store code primarily because it is a remote repository. If your computer is on a death kneel, you can be confident that you can use your remote repository to help recover/clone what you previously had. However, beyond this fairly obvious benefit, it is also a great way to share your code with partners.
