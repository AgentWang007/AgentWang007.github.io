  <h1>Conflict Resolution</h1>
  <h2> Does HR need to get involved? </h2>
  <h4>08/28/2015</h4>
    <h4> Intro </h4>
    <p>
Conflict. Man, my life has been full of it. As suggested by DBC, I won’t focus on a major conflict. Instead, i will focus on the issue of conflicts. Since I’ve been in academia for a long time, there tends to be a lot of “social back-stabbing” or “cliques.” It doesn’t matter how old you are or how mature you think you are. When you end up in a setting with X amount of individuals that constitute a microcosm, you will end up in a situation that could potentially become drama. In fact, I have already spoken to a few pairing partners that had complaints about their pairs.
    </p>
    <h4> Phase 0 Example </h4>
    <p>
Although most don’t want to resort to calling anyone specifically out, we definitely end up voicing opinions more about when something goes bad versus something going right. In this example, I don’t think anyone got into a verbal fist-fight on google+. At worst, people chose to just avoid trying to pair with that individual again. Regarding myself, I’ve had a few mediocre pairing partnerships. This ranges from one partner ignoring teamwork to another partner who got snippy. However, it is probably inevitable that you will pair with that person again if you are in the same cohort. Luckily,I have not come across anyone in my particular cohort that is just plain “lousy” to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
 It’s automatically juicier, more substantial to write about, and talking it out is somewhat liberating. The question is whether or not to gossip about it in the first place. We’re there to STUDY, right?  I don’t have a specific story to tell because life has been full of these type of stressful squabbles. Generally, I used to deal with them by indulging the complainer or complaining about the individual. It’s cathartic! It is absolutely okay to complain when you feel something. It actually becomes more important to consider what else you should do with this sentiment.
    </p>

<h4> How to Deal </h4>
  <p>
For example, if I disliked working with somebody, I don’t think I should be spreading that negative sentiment to somebody else that has not worked with the person. I don’t want to taint that particular encounter and honestly they may develop a chemistry that I just didn’t have with them. Due to a relative lack of self-esteem, I usually resort to self-introspection if I don’t get along with somebody else initially. If I determine that I am not necessarily the only reason for a partnership not working, I think about how I would have improved that relationships without compromising myself. What this means is that I think about how I can put the best of myself toward an endeavor with somebody else. Unfortunately, I can’t fix the bad partnerships that I had. However, I always hope to apply some experience and life lessons toward the next one.
  </p>

  <p>
One simple way to deal with some groups is to try some simple camaraderie when trying to work out something difficult together. I noticed that my worst pairings involved long periods of silence while flipping through pages. It doesn’t hurt to try to ice-break it a bit with a tiny joke or a conversational aside. It makes it less frustrating to worth through a problem if both parties are relaxed. In addition, I have also tried to defuse potential bad partnerships is to be as PREPARED as possible. When It comes to these releases, I actually come up with a preliminary pseudo-code or user story when reading the exercise. This ABSOLUTELY does not  mean that the partner has to follow my pseudocode. However, it cuts down on that initial “What the hell are we doing” at the beginning and at least gives us a place to start on a conversational level.
