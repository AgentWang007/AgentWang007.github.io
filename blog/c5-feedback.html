 <h1>Feedback</h1>
  <h2>Straight to the Jugular</h2>
  <h4>08/05/2015</h4>
    <h4>Intro</h4>
    <p>
      In the interest of reducing the amount of times I go off course, I decided to address each point directly like it is a simple Q&A.  Imagine you are in the audience asking the questions while I’m sitting on stage with a microphone. 3..2..1…ACTION.
    </p>
    <h4> The Pairing </h4>
    <p>
       <em> Woman with iguana on her lap: What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</em>

    </p>
    <p>
        It’s been generally mixed and I am leaning toward positive. Some of pairs have been excellent and some of the pairs have been lackluster. Of course, it generally depends on the person, but I think it really comes down to deciding the whole navigator/driver relationship. It is particularly difficult for some people to NOT TAKE OVER the entire process as opposed to actually working with somebody.

    </p>
    <p>
        Most times, yeah. After a few of the team-ups, I ended up making friends and even discuss some of the topics outside of required pairing sessions. When you end up creating a final product that actually works, you do want to high-five somebody over the coderpad.io or chat window. However, these high-fives are only warranted if the partnership isn’t overtly one-sided. One thing that is pretty neat is that each person clearly comes to coding from a different background. One of the pairing partners I met actually told me this and it makes a fair amount of sense. When you look at somebody’s navigation or writing, you can sort of get an insight into how their brains work. For example, I figured out that my code is a bit verbose, but fairly engrained in taking each possible step. You learn from others how to do some code as a result which is extremely rewarding. Also, you can get a sense on how on the level you are with the rest of the group if you find different people.

        </p>


<em> 5 year old girl who just threw a tantrum: Was something frustrating and difficult for you? </em>

  <p>
        I mentioned this earlier, but some partners are frustrating. They are frustrating not due to intelligence issues. Instead, they are frustrating because they seem to be focused on finishing the assignment and not learning it. As a result, the roles gets muddled and learning potential decreases as a result. For example, I did a GPS challenge with a partner on HTML/CSS which ended up with us working on the same code at the same time. In addition to being difficult to keep track, he didn’t end up discussing what he was doing. Now, this man was nice enough, but he was also just charging as fast as he can toward a finish line. On another challenge, I worked with an individual that wanted to work a VERY SPECIFIC WAY. I understand it is understandable to get used to people like this. However, it makes it hard to voice your concerns when they immediately steam-roll any chance of a true collaboration.

  </p>

 <h4> Feedback - Let's forgoe the fake audience</h4>

  <p>
       Generally, I felt the reactions were fair. I am new at coding so I may come across as being “unlearned” during some of the sessions. On the other hand, I feel some of the reviews are stretching to just add criticism. I’m not being arrogant when I say this though. I have a difficult time giving constructive feedback due to my laid-back persona. If the person was knowledge and easy to work with, I almost have nothing to complain about. I don’t like critiquing people unless they really earned it. Also, the feedback is not entirely anonymous early on so I do take that into account when writing feedback. I definitely took some of the feedback to heart and think on those points when pairing. For example, if I came across as disorganized in an earlier pair, I try to take the reins early on for the next one.
