  <h1>An Impression of the Tech World</h1>
  <h2>Security Issues to Consider as a Developer</h2>
  <h4>08/01/2015</h4>
    <h4>We Care?</h4>
    <p>
   So, who hear owns an android phone? As of this post, the world found out recently that every android phone on the planet has the same critical flaw and that it would be very difficult to fix. Basically, someone can send the user a text message that contains malware. Normally, this wouldn’t sound like a big deal, but google Hangouts pre-processes attachments even if you haven’t seen the message. Supposedly, the error allows the attacker to take control of your phone and even access features such as your phone. Honestly, this is a scary prospect. However, I think the bigger issue is whether people care or not. I ended up sharing this news with friends and family, but was generally surprised by the tepid reaction. Actually, I’m not surprised since the everyday American doesn’t care about a problem until it directly impacts them. To be fair, there are definitely people that reply to these charges with anger or a critical eye. However, I am generally thinking about the overall apathetic tone one will encounter.

    <h4> Apathy? </h4>
    <p>
       Remember when the Sony leak happened? With all the e-mail links, you would believe that more people would be worried about the security infrastructure. However, it almost seems like people were concerned about the the content of the leaks and the media circus as opposed to the implications. When people are asked about this situation, they are almost resigned to the fact that they can’t really do anything about it anyway since their world are irreversibly tied to these technologies. They’ll only really be in an uproar when they get directly impacted by it. I’m writing about this because I now have to consider this attitude from a developer point of view.

    <h4> What should be the developer attitude? </h4>
    <p>
   First, I would hope to fix problems in order to improve the product such as adding features. However, I am also well that we will also be fixing problems from irate customers or security flaws that mar the overall product. Instead of falling back on the previous lais·sez-faire approach, I have to consider what it is like to be the person responsible for these problems or even the ones in charge of fixing it. It’s a completely different role to be the creator and not the user. In terms of feeling, does apathy play a role in these horrific situation? I understand being idealistic though since I am only an upcoming software developer. However, I like to think that there would be a particular POV I would adopt in order to encounter these situations. I honestly don’t know what the approach would be though. I imagine it must be tough to be put under the microscope by your superiors as the bad press builds up. It’s something to think about though. In our job as developers, we will be handling personal information that people are easily giving us without any concern for their personal safety. I suppose the only thing we can do is to attempt the best job we can. If “shit hits the fan,” we just have to haul ass and fix it. Apathy won’t fix the problem, I think? What about the apathy in the user base who won’t even set up the simple firewall? It sounds silly, but I would consider a way to make users thoughtful of security without making it an inconvenience or disrupting their everyday usage. Hmm. There is a fair amount to ponder and I imagine I will make more as I step further into this world.
