  <h1>Impressions about the DBC</h1>
  <h2>Let's Talk Analogy</h2>
  <h4>07/10/2015</h4>
    <h4> The "Idiot"</h4>
    <p>
      Based on the video, I will classify myself as one of the "idiots" that will pop up in this camp. It isn't as mean as it sounds because I am sort of starting from ground zero. I don't think it really makes me an idiot in a negative way though. I just don't know much about this particular part of the world at the moment. When growing up, I was always enanormed and interesting in engaging in the technological world, but I was held back by ridiculous personal matters that would require its own blog and a book deal to even approach. If anything, I have always toyed around, but I never learned to refine my learning habits to engage beyond the surface.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who is new and I look forward to becoming less of an "idiot."
    </p>
    <h4> The Analogy </h4>
    <p>
        The restaurant analogy is a good one. When I order a meal at a normal restaurant, I never get angry for bad meal. I usually accept that I made a decision to test the waters of taste and I will never end up trying it again. I would hope to treat the DBC experience as a buffet instead. For the uninitiatied, the Chinese buffets around the country are well-known for over-feeding the populace with hopefully at-least average cuisine spanning from China to the American Ellios pizza. Depending on your viewpoint, this can be fantastic or horrible. However, any person who goes to this buffet can come out full and satisified if they play the cards right.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't want to make presumptions about how this program runs. I can only speculate on how I want to approach it with this ridiculous buffet analogy. I'm going to try EVERYTHING that looks good to me with an open mind. Since this education model is more driven by the student, I also want to take the time to figure out the best way for me to engage in the material. Similar to this forced analogy of the buffet, I like to mix and match the food in order to create a new dish. So, I could take the dumplings, mix it with one of their bland soup bases, add scallions, add the broccoli from the stir fry, and throw it all together with lo mein. I'm hopefully going to experiment a fair amount in curriculum and the level of success will be dictated by me for the most part.

        One of my best friends, who is a hardware engineer, once told me that programming is similar to setting up a restaurant. Let's say I wanted to create a Spanish restaurant. I can learn Spanish, but I still have no idea how to run a restaurant. I can learn how to run a restaurant, but I don't think could run it well without knowing Spanish. Basically, he was insinuating that learning the language won't magically create projects without knowing how the kitchen (software basics) works. However, learning kitchen basics can help the user learn the language by being an excellent starting point. Once you figured out how to run one successful restuarant, it becomes easier to franchise it or even start an entirely new venture. It may not make sense to you, but it sort of weirdly makes sense for me.
